Highlight
=========

[VERSION: 0.1]

Builds a custom registry for manipulating highlights. In particular, I found it
necessary to search for different keywords without overriding previous searches;
that is, I wanted to be able to continue adding more words to a search without
having to keep track of which words I've already searched for.

Refer to ```doc/``` for instructions on use.
